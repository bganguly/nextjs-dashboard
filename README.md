# Dashboard — Next.js + Prisma + AWS RDS

Production-grade **Next.js 16 / TypeScript** full-stack orders dashboard delivering sub-second search
and chart responses across 500 k orders: full-text search, pre-aggregated analytics tables,
persistent count cache, Server-Sent Events for live updates, and Terraform IaC on AWS.

**[→ Portfolio demo](https://bganguly.github.io/?open=nextjs)**

## Using the App

1. **Search** — type in the search bar to find orders by customer name; sub-second via customer-id enumeration + GIN index on 500 k rows.
2. **Aggregates** — the chart shows daily order totals by category from pre-aggregated tables; never touches raw orders.
3. **Live updates** — open a second tab to the Quick Order tool and place an order; the dashboard refreshes within ~100 ms via SSE.

### Cost control — scheduled 8am–5pm Pacific window (weekdays)

EC2 auto-stops on a weekday schedule managed by EventBridge Scheduler. **RDS runs 24/7** — stopping it flushes PostgreSQL `shared_buffers`, making the first search of every morning cold (~1 s on EBS). Keeping RDS up matches the GCP pattern where the Postgres VM never stops.

| Resource | Scale-up | Scale-down | Idle cost | ~$/mo ¹ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **EC2 t3.small** (lite & full) | 8am PT Mon–Fri | 5pm PT Mon–Fri | ~$0 (stopped) | ~$4 |
| **RDS db.t3.micro** (lite) + 20 GB storage | always-on | always-on | billed continuously | ~$14 |
| **RDS db.t3.large** (full) + 50 GB storage | always-on | always-on | billed continuously | ~$110 |
| **Lite total** | | | | **~$18/mo** |
| **Full total** | | | | **~$124/mo** |

¹ EC2 ≈ 200 hrs/month active (scheduled); RDS 720 hrs/month. On-demand us-east-1 pricing.

> **Savings if you also stop RDS on schedule** (~$8/mo lite, ~$75/mo full): re-enable by adding back `start_rds` / `stop_rds` schedules in `infra/main.tf` — at the cost of cold-cache first-search latency each morning.

`./scripts/deploy.sh` shows an interactive prompt at the top of every remote run:

```
  EC2: running       RDS: available (always-on)
  Auto-schedule: starts 8 am · stops 5 pm · weekdays Pacific · state=ENABLED
  [1] Start now  [2] Stop now  [3] Suspend schedule  [4] Resume schedule  [enter] Continue:
```

> **Note:** AWS auto-restarts a stopped RDS instance after 7 continuous days — the weekday schedule prevents this from happening unintentionally.

## Live Service

> **Schedule:** EC2 runs weekdays 8 am – 5 pm PT (EventBridge auto-start/stop). Outside those hours the app is offline and shows a maintenance page.

### Key design decisions

| Concern | Approach |
|---|---|
| **Search performance** | Customer-id enumeration (`SELECT id FROM customers WHERE name ILIKE`) then `customerId = ANY(ids)` join on orders — avoids full-table ILIKE scan; GIN index on customers covers the probe |
| **Chart performance** | Pre-aggregated `daily_summary`, `daily_customer_category_summary`, `daily_status_category_summary`, `daily_filter_category_summary` — chart queries never touch raw orders |
| **Count performance** | Persistent `count_cache` table (10-min TTL) + startup warmup for first-page tokens — eliminates repeat COUNT(*) scans on 500 k rows |
| **Sort stability** | `placedAt DESC, id DESC` tiebreaker on all sort fields — prevents row duplication or skipping across pages |
| **Real-time** | SSE over HTTP long-poll — no WebSocket server needed; compatible with Next.js API routes; dashboard updates within ~100 ms of order creation |

---

## Snapshot / Demo Data

Seeding 4 M orders takes ~15-20 min. A maintainer can bake a `pg_dump` snapshot to a private S3
object and restore it in minutes:

```bash
DEMO_SNAPSHOT_S3_URI=s3://<bucket>/dash/demo.dump ./scripts/bake-demo-snapshot.sh

DEMO_SNAPSHOT_S3_URI=s3://<bucket>/dash/demo.dump ./scripts/prepare-demo-data.sh
```

Developers cloning from GitHub have no S3 access and automatically fall back to the full seed path.

## Transactional Outbox — Aggregate Upkeep

`createOrder` (`lib/services/orders.service.ts`) writes the order + its items **and** one
`order_events` outbox row in a single `prisma.$transaction` — no dual-write gap. A separate
process, `scripts/aggregates-worker.ts`, drains that table and performs the 7 aggregate-table
writes (`order_category_facts` + 6 `daily_*_summary`/`rollup` upserts) asynchronously, off the
request path. This replaced an earlier design where `createOrder` fired all 7 writes
synchronously/fire-and-forget, which could exhaust Prisma's connection pool under concurrent order
creation (a real `Timed out fetching a new connection from the connection pool` 500 was reproduced
and fixed by this change).

Key properties:
- **Atomic per event**: the worker claims one row via `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, runs all
  7 updates, and marks it `processedAt` inside one transaction — a crash mid-processing rolls back
  cleanly and is safely retried, never double-counted.
- **Multi-worker safe**: `SKIP LOCKED` means running more than one worker instance against the same
  table never double-processes a row (horizontal scaling is safe by construction).
- **Fail-open with visibility**: failures increment `attempts`/`lastError` on the outbox row instead
  of silently vanishing (today's now-removed `.catch(() => {})` pattern could permanently
  undercount an aggregate with zero trace); capped at 5 attempts before a row is left for
  inspection.
- **The SSE live-feed (`publishOrderEvent` → `/api/stream`) is untouched** — it still fires
  immediately after the order commits, independent of the outbox/worker.
- Started automatically by `scripts/local-dev.sh` and `scripts/deploy.sh` (via
  `scripts/start-aggregates-worker.sh`, a detached process managed with a pidfile + `nohup`).
  Manage it directly with `scripts/start-aggregates-worker.sh` / `stop-aggregates-worker.sh` /
  `restart-aggregates-worker.sh`.

### How a future agent should test this

1. **Confirm both processes are up**:
   ```bash
   lsof -nP -iTCP:3004 -sTCP:LISTEN                 # dashboard
   cat scripts/aggregates-worker.pid && ps -p "$(cat scripts/aggregates-worker.pid)" -o pid,command
   ```
   If the worker isn't running: `./scripts/start-aggregates-worker.sh` (no-op if already up).

2. **Concurrency no longer exhausts the pool** — the original bug this fixes. Fire a burst of
   concurrent creates and expect all `201`s, fast, with no `connection limit` 500s:
   ```bash
   for i in $(seq 1 15); do
     curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{time_total}s\n' -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/orders \
       -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
       -d '{"customerId":1,"regionId":1,"items":[{"productId":1,"quantity":2,"unitPrice":19.99}]}' &
   done; wait
   ```

3. **Outbox fills then drains** (LISTEN-driven, near-instant; 2s poll is the fallback):
   ```bash
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c 'SELECT id, "orderId", "processedAt", attempts FROM order_events ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 15;'
   sleep 3
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c 'SELECT id, "orderId", "processedAt", attempts FROM order_events ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 15;'
   # expect processedAt populated for all of them
   ```

4. **Aggregates reconcile exactly** — no double-counting, no missed rows. Compare the count of
   `order_category_facts` rows against the number of orders created in a known burst (should be
   equal):
   ```bash
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c 'SELECT count(*) FROM order_category_facts WHERE "orderId" IN (SELECT "orderId" FROM order_events WHERE id > <first_id_of_burst>);'
   ```

5. **`SKIP LOCKED` under two workers** — start a second, unmanaged instance alongside the
   pidfile-tracked one, fire a fresh burst, and confirm exactly N rows get `processedAt` set (not
   2N — that would mean double-processing):
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/aggregates-worker.ts > /tmp/worker2.log 2>&1 &
   WORKER2_PID=$!
   # ...fire a burst of N orders, then...
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c 'SELECT count(*) FROM order_events WHERE "processedAt" IS NOT NULL AND id > <first_id_of_burst>;'
   kill "$WORKER2_PID"
   ```

6. **Crash recovery** — build a backlog (stop the worker first so it accumulates), hard-kill the
   worker (`kill -9 "$(cat scripts/aggregates-worker.pid)"`), confirm some rows may be
   `processedAt IS NULL` still, then `./scripts/start-aggregates-worker.sh` and confirm the backlog
   finishes draining with the aggregate delta still exactly N (not doubled, not short). Note: this
   worker drains fast (100+ events/sec observed), so catching it truly mid-transaction requires a
   large backlog (200+) and either a tight poll loop or an artificial delay — the atomicity
   guarantee itself is standard Postgres transaction semantics via `prisma.$transaction`, not
   something bespoke to verify from scratch each time.

### Verified baseline — treat as the regression threshold

These are the actual measured results from the session that built this feature, run against the
local `dashboard_perf` DB (~100k orders at the time). **A future change to this pipeline (schema,
worker loop, `createOrder`, or the 7 aggregate updaters) should reproduce results at least this
good** — if a re-run comes back slower or reconciles less exactly, treat that as a regression, not
noise.

| Check | Verified result |
|---|---|
| Concurrent order creation (was: 500 "connection limit: 9" at 3 concurrent, pre-fix) | 15 concurrent `POST /api/orders`, all `201`, **113ms–267ms** each, zero pool errors |
| Outbox drain latency | Backlogs of 15 / 30 / 100 / 187 / 263 orders all reached `processedAt` populated on **every** row within the 2s idle-poll window (LISTEN-driven drains were sub-second in practice) |
| Aggregate reconciliation (`order_category_facts` count vs. orders created) | Exact match at every burst size tested: 15/15, 30/30, 100/100, 187/187, 263/263 — zero discrepancy |
| Aggregate reconciliation (`daily_customer_category_summary.totalOrders` sum vs. orders created) | Exact match: 15/15 |
| `SKIP LOCKED` double-claim prevention | Two worker instances run concurrently against a 100-row backlog → exactly **100** rows marked `processedAt` (not 200) |
| Worker throughput (observed, not a hard guarantee) | A 187-row backlog was fully drained somewhere between 0.6s (0 processed) and 1.5s (187/187 processed) after worker start — i.e. **100+ events/sec** sustained, which is also why manufacturing a true mid-transaction crash test via a bash timing race proved impractical (see note above) |
| Backlog survives worker restarts | Stopped/restarted the worker several times over accumulated backlogs (up to 263 rows) — every restart fully drained the remainder with **no double-counted totals** in any run |
